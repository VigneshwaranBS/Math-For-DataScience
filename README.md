Statistics and math for machine learning and data science.

Welcome to the "Math for Machine Learning" repository! This repository is dedicated to providing an overview of important mathematical concepts and techniques that are fundamental for understanding machine learning and data science. Whether you're just starting out or looking to refresh your math skills, you'll find resources and explanations for various topics in this repository.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Logarithms (1_log)

Learn about logarithmic functions, their properties, and how they are used in mathematical and scientific contexts. Understand the relationship between logarithms and exponential functions.

### 3. Normal Distribution (3_normal_distribution)

Explore the normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, and its significance in statistics. Learn how to calculate probabilities and use the standard normal distribution.

### 4. Mean and Percentile (4_mean_percentile)

Discover the concept of mean and how it measures the central tendency of a dataset. Understand percentiles and their role in analyzing data distribution.

### 5. Log-Normal Distribution (5_log_normal_distribution)

Dive deeper into the log-normal distribution, which is used to model skewed data that may follow an exponential growth pattern. Explore its properties and applications.

### 6. Cosine Similarity (6_cosine_similarity)

Learn about cosine similarity, a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors. Understand how it is used in natural language processing and recommendation systems.

### 7. Modified Z-Score (7_modified_z_score)

Explore the modified Z-score, an alternative method for identifying outliers in a dataset. Compare it to the standard Z-score and understand its advantages.
